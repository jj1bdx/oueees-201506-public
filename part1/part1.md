# Sustainable computer systems

---

## Smaller devices

* Vacuum tubes (~1950s)
* Transistors
* Integrated circuits (ICs)
* Using less energy per device

---

## Smaller electronic circuits

* Hand mounting: TO-92, TO-220, 
* Hand mounting ICs: SIP, DIP
* Surface mounting: SOIC, BGA, PGA
* Higher density
* Using the *same* energy per *system*

---

## Moore's law

---

## Energy consumption

---

## Can we proceed?
