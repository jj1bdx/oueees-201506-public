# Cloud computing systems

---

---

# Cloud computing elements

* Servers and services on the Internet
* Endpoint terminals (smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc.) *outside* the cloud
* *Highly centralized systems depending on the Internet*

---

# Inside the services

* A cluster of distributed systems
* Multiple computers *collaboratively* connected to do the same task
* *Highly decentralized* or even *distributed*

## Centralized social behavior accerelated by cloud computing

* Sharing *everything* - no privacy
* *Panopticon* [^3] style of governance, filtering, *censorship, or autocracy*
* Complete *externalization* of resources, leading to *no personal control*

[^3]: n. a circular prison with cells arranged around a central well, from which prisoners could at all times be observed. (New Oxford American Dictionary, Apple OS X 10.10.3)

The slogans: [^5]

* War is peace
* Freedom is slavery
* Ignorance is strength

* Independent thinking = *thoughtcrime*

## NOTE: this is a *fiction*!

# Why cloud computing has become so *dystopian*?

---

# We have sold freedom for *convenience*

---

## Convenience of centralized systems

* Ubiquitous/global accessibility
* Concentrated data for easy analysis
* Easy control of the information flow
* No extra cost for sharing
* No need to think about where the information locates

---

# The inconvenient truth of centralized systems

---

# What if the core/cloud fails?

![right](When-core-fails.png)

---

## Inconvenience of centralized systems

* Ubiquity or *no accessibility*
* When the core fails, no alternative
* When the core loses data, *no backup*
* The system performance is restricted by the capability of the core
* Endpoint systems will lost *all capabilities*

---

# Centralized systems are *not* sustainable

---

# Sustainable information systems: decentralized and distributed

---

# Real-world challenges

* Natural disasters
* Device failures
* Human operation errors
* Political impediments
* Social resentments

---

# Handling *failures*

* Redundancy: keeping backup units ready
* Fault tolerance: keeping systems running even the components fail
* Resilience by failing fast: early detection of failures and invocation of the recovery procedures
